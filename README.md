# SIMPLE CALCULATOR APP USING FLUTTER

In this project I built a simple calculator App that can perform basic Arithmetic operations like addition,
subtraction, multiplication or division depending upon the user Input.

Concepts used **Showing Widgets on the screen,**
              **Gridview.builder,**
              **Function Writing**

## Coding Calculator App

In the Lib folder, there is a **main.dart** file already present. And now in the same folder create a new file named **buttons.dart**. Starting with **main.dart** file. Create **MyApp** class and make it **StatelessWidget**. Add an array of buttons to be displayed. Set the background-color, text-color, text-color, functionality **onTapped** to the buttons.
